Thank you for dropping by.

I am a software professional based in India trying to find sense in a senseless world around us. My interests include technology, entrepreneurship, business, films, culture, society, politics, history, and almost everything. This blog is a collection of my learnings. Hope you find it interesting.

I am an Indian and hence look into things from an Indian point of view. I am highly influenced by this hymn from *Nâsadiya-Sukta*, Rig-Veda, X. 129

This talks of creation and ends with a classic question 

**God Knows Everything or Does He really Know. You go and figure**

For me, what these verses do is urge us to probe deeper, develop a scientific temperament and engage in an intense philosophical inquiry into the nature of our existence.

## THE HYMN OF CREATION

(A translation of the *Nâsadiya-Sukta*, Rig-Veda, X. 129.)
