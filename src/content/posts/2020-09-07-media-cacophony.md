For the past few years, have been greatly troubled by the media cacophony around us. Have tried to avoid it but its very difficult. Have stopped watching news channels but invariably, every day morning somebody or the other will post a video on social media and the brouhaha starts. 

So around a few months back, created something called as a mental model which is given below.  All the news items which is propagated and highlighted falls in one of the categories shown below. This template is used over and over to highlight the differences and gloss over the commonalities.  

* My language is the language of the gods, Your language is all gibberish and can't be called as a language.
* My food habits has been shaped by gods, Your food can't be called as food.
* My history is the actual truth, Your history is all made up of stories.
* My decision making and thought process is very refined. Your decisions are all worthless.
* My beliefs are scientific. Your beliefs are all superstition. 
* My community has been wronged across generations. Your community grievances are all imagined.
* My family members are all meritorious and talented. Your family members have succeeded because of nepotism.
* My dress habits reflects my culture. Your culture doesn't even have a dress sense.
* My family members are all perfect and loving, Your family members have corrupted my innocent family.
* My culture is above perfection. Your culture is barbaric and needs urgent reform.
* My job, is because of talent and hardwork. Your job is because of luck.
* My choice, I can reject you or accept you. You have no choice but to accept me.
* What all I have is mine and non-negotiable, What all you have is always open for negotiations.

So once you know which template the news falls into, you will start seeing the same news items in a different light. 

There was a time in late 80s when state held Doordarshan was the main news channel and the daily news items would be the minister's schedule, the inauguration of a satellite tower etc. At that time we would want a dynamic channel for minute by minute reporting. Now we have multiple channels doing minute by minute reporting and I think most people would prefer the older Doordarshan based reporting style.

A few years from now, how will all this change, will it get better or worse. How much worse can it get before it all breaks down. Interesting and painful times ahead.
