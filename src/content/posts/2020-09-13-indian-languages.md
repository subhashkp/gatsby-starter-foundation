Aranmula Parthasarathy Temple is one of the five ancient shrines in the Chengannur area of Kerala, connected with the legend of Mahabharata, where the five Pandavas are believed to have built one temple each; Thrichittatt Maha Vishnu Temple by Yudhishthira, Puliyur Mahavishnu Temple by Bheema, Aranmula by Arjuna, Thiruvanvandoor Mahavishnu Temple by Nakula and Thrikodithanam Mahavishnu Temple to Sahadeva. 

Around 500 years back the local king got some artisans from Tamil Nadu to work on the renovation of the temple and while working at the Parthasarathi Temple with different metals, the craftsmen had come upon a special alloy that had sharp reflective properties and doubled up as a mirror. Pleased with their metallurgical skills, the king invited them to stay back in Aranmula. Although it is known that the alloy is a mix of copper and tin, the preparation is still a secret. This mirror is still made using the same techniques and is known as the Aranmula Kannadi or the Aranmula mirror.

The Aranmula kannadi is a front surface reflection mirror, which eliminates secondary reflections and aberrations typical of back surface mirrors, wherein image is reflected from the bottom layer where mercury is pasted. Thus one can say that a person sees his or her real image reflected only in the Aranmula kannadi. Members of five families with traditional skilled artisan-ship alone know about the manufacturing process of this object of wonder. These families speak a language which is a mix of tamil and malayalam and this family secret has somehow survived into the modern era. Around 2002, the world recognized the craftsmanship of these traditional metallurgist and the GI tag was provided, which also helped in marketing this mirror across the world.

Since their skills were recognized, the youngsters in these families stayed in their family professions, otherwise they would have moved to different jobs and their local language would have lost. Their language would have been replaced by Malayalam, Tamil, English or Hindi, as these are the languages which are needed in the modern world. Within two to three generations these traditional family secrets would have been lost. 

Was wondering about this when the recent controversy about Tamil Nadu DMK MP Kanimozhi's complaint against the CISF erupted. She was asked whether she was as Indian as she was not speaking Hindi. 

Normally the language controversy is always between the central government pushing for Hindi and the non hindi speaking states opposing it in various degrees. The main narrative is, its mostly opposed in South India specifically Tamil Nadu but I don't think that's the case. If push comes to the shove, no state govt will hesitate to put up a fight for their respective languages.

The Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India, as of 1 December 2007, lists 22 languages which are  –Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Malayalam, Manipuri, Marathi, Nepali, Oriya, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu, Bodo, Santhali, Maithili and Dogri.

Hindi speakers are around 43% of the population. But if we look into the data clearly things start looking interesting. See below the list of languages which has more than 10 lac speakers.  There are around 40 languages outside the main 22 languages which are spoken by more than 10 lac people. Out of this around 26 languages are grouped under Hindi i.e. Bhojpuri with 5 crore speakers, Rajasthani with 2.5 crore speakers is under Hindi.

Not just Hindi, every 22 major  languages has multiple languages under it. The no of languages classified under Tamil and the no of speakers are shown below.

* Irula/Irular Mozhi (11,870 )
* Kaikadi ( 25,870 )
* Korava ( 10,421 )
* Yerukala/Yerukula ( 58,065 )

According to UNESCO India has potentially around 600 endangered languages and around 250 languages have already died in the past 60 years.

When a language dies, its speakers decide to migrate. First, they migrate to another language and then they physically start migrating to another region. The second thing that happens is that their traditional livelihood patterns go down. They may have some special skills and that disappears. Thirdly, a unique way of looking at the world disappears. Every language is a unique worldview. \

These special skills could be like the secrets of the Aranmula Kannadi, or maybe some family still has the secret for Ashok sthamb, the iron pillar which doesn't rust. The cuisines, the music, the farming style everything is lost when we go for a mono culture.  

## The Future

The govt pushes for a single language, Hindi in this case because from a governance point of view its always better. Governments don't want to take the pain and that pain is  pushed back to the common man. The common man was always Atmanirbhar and most of the people in India are multilingual \
\
People talk about Germany using German, Japan using Japanese and advise to follow their path, but why can't we have our own path.

* In today's technology driven world, we don't need to restrict to a single language. We need to start with documenting and recording all the Indian languages and ask the people to communicate in whatever language they are comfortable. The pain area should be taken by the govt.  
* As the NLP ( Natural Languages processing ) technology is progressing very fast, it can be used to quickly translate from any language to another. India has around 19,500 languages, So if 10 experts are created for each language, 1.95 lac jobs are created. IT can easily create multiple opportunities in linguistics, IT, music and related fields. 
* Once we have the framework to work between these languages it can be easily extended to the rest of the world. When China is asking the world to learn Chinese, we can tell the world, you use your local languages, we have the tools to work with you.
* The Government of India has a Scheme known as “Protection and Preservation of Endangered Languages of India (SPPEL)”. This Scheme is run by the Central Institute of Indian Languages (CIIL) which is based in Mysore. This should be enlarged and we should have indigenous languages day programs regularly. 
* On an Individual level, we shouldn't be condescending when somebody speaks an different language in our midst.

Maybe when working with these languages and mining those languages, we may or may not discover the lost treasures but will make us far more emphatic to different viewpoints.
